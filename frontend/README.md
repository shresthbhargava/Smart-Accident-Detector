# Smart Accident Detector

## Project Description
This is a full-stack web application that serves as an intelligent emergency detection system. The platform is designed to connect to live video devices like drones or CCTV and stream real-time footage to a backend powered by a pre-trained accident detection model. This model analyzes the video feed instantly to detect accidents with high accuracy. The results are then displayed on a dynamic web dashboard, providing rapid and actionable alerts to enhance emergency response and situational awareness.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Video Feed**: Streams live video for immediate analysis.
- **Accident Detection**: A pre-trained model provides accurate and instant accident detection.
- **Dynamic Web Dashboard**: Displays system statistics, a live video feed, and a chronological log of alerts.
- **Automated Alerts**: Generates rapid, actionable alerts for detected incidents.
- **Drone Fleet Status**: Monitors the real-time status of a fleet of drones.
- **User Interface**: Includes a login page and a dashboard with a theme toggle for a professional user experience.

## Technologies and File Structure
- **index.html**: The primary HTML file that structures the web application's user interface.
- **styles.css**: Manages the visual styling of the application, including custom themes for light and dark modes.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for dynamic content, user authentication, and interactive features like theme switching and data refresh.
